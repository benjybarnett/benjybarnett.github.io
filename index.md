# About Me

<br>
Hey, I'm **Benjy**! <br><br>

I am a Cognitive Neuroscience PhD student in the <a href="https://metacoglab.org/">MetaLab</a> at the Wellcome Center for Human Neuroimaging, UCL. My research spans all things **consciousness**, **perception**, **numerical** and **social** cognition. 


## What I've been up to

**<font color='red'>[!]</font> I am looking for post-doc to start in Autumn 2024. Please get in touch if you'd be interested in collaborating!**
<br>
<br>
I'm currently in the final year of my PhD, where I've been working with <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/people/steve-fleming">Steve Fleming</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/nadinedijkstra/about-me?authuser=0">Nadine Dijkstra</a> at UCL. My research has developed into two broad streams: <br>**1** exploring how neural magnitude codes may be shared between cognitive domains, and how they might interface with neural correlates of consciousness <br>**2** adapting social cognition paradigms for use in naturalistic experiments, using brand new wearable OP-MEG technologies.<br><br>

Before my PhD, I worked as an RA with <a href="https://www.freemanlab.org/">Jon Freeman</a> at NYU, where I used fMRI to explore how visual awareness facilitates the top-down influence of stereotypes on face perception. Before that, I completed my MSc at the <a href="https://www.sussex.ac.uk/research/centres/sussex-centre-for-consciousness-science/">Sackler Centre for Consciousness Science</a>, where, supervised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/keisukesuzuki/home?authuser=0">Keisuke Suzuki</a>, I combined psychophysical experiments with virtual reality models of hallucinations.
