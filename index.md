# About Me

<img src="images/me.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">
<br>
Hey, I'm **Benjy**! <br>

I am a Cognitive Neuroscience PhD student in the <a href="https://metacoglab.org/MetaLab">MetaLab</a> at University College London. MY research spans all things **consciousness**, **perception**, **numerical**, and **social** cognition. 


## What I've been up to

**<font color='red'>[!]</font> I am looking for post-doc to start in Autumn 2024. CPlease get in touch if you'd be interested in collaborating!**
<br>

I'm currently in the final year of my PhD, where I've been working with <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/people/steve-fleming">Steve Fleming</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/nadinedijkstra/about-me?authuser=0">Nadine Dijkstra</a> at UCL. My research has developed into two broad streams: <br>***1*** exploring how neural magnitude codes may be shared between cognitive domains, and how they might interface with neural correlates of consciousness and <br>***2*** adapting social cognition paradigms for use in naturalistic experiments, using brand new wearable OP-MEG technologies.<br>
Before my PhD, I worked as an RA with <a href="https://www.freemanlab.org/">Jon Freeman</a> at NYU, where I used fMRI to explore how visual awareness facilitates the top-down influence of stereotypes on face perception. Before that, I completed my MSc in Intelligent and Adaptive Systems at the <a href="https://www.sussex.ac.uk/research/centres/sussex-centre-for-consciousness-science/">Sackler Centre for Consciousness Science</a>, where, supervised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/keisukesuzuki/home?authuser=0">Keisuke Suzuki</a>, I modelled visual hallucinations in virtual reality, and tested the impact this had on participants' use of priors during noise perception.

## Research Interests

- Internet of Everything (IoE)
- Industrial Automation
- Network and Cybersecurity
- Applied Machine Learning
- [My latest research proposal](https://caihanlin.com/file/proposal-2023.pdf) üîó

My current research focuses on practical problems that artificial intelligence faces in real life. My interests are on the **Machine Learning** and its applications in **Industrial IoT**. In a word, advanced technologies like ML and IoT positively influence the life of everybody.  I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.
